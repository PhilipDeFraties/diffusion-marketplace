        hundreds of frontline employee innovators. Through a three-tiered evidence-based investment program,
        <%= link_to 'Spark-Seed-Spread', 'https://www.va.gov/INNOVATIONECOSYSTEM/views/solutions/spark-seed-spread.html', class: 'go-fish-link', target: '_blank' %>, iNET invests
        funding back into VHA employees and VAMCs, allowing employees to test and develop their ideas and solutions in an accelerated
        lifecycle. During this prototype development and pilot lifecycle, investees receive VHA-specific innovation competency training via
        the Innovation Accelerator Program.

      <p class="margin-bottom-2 line-height-sans-26px">
        Innovative thinking and passionate employees do not of course only exist at these 33 sites; creative and innovative work is being
        done by employees throughout VHA. iNET has recognized this as well, and is expanding the opportunity to participate in
        Spark-Seed-Spread nationally. Go Fish! is an innovation competition for employees not located at an iNET site to potentially
        participate in the Spark-Seed-Spread Investment Program.
